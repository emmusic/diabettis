The aim of this project is to explore the Pima Indian dataset of women with and without diabetes. 

1. Descriptive Analytics
2. Predictive Analytics unsupervised and supervised

I first reduced the features using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called Principal Component Analysis. Then, I used an oversampling technique on my training dataset in order to balance out my positive and negative classes. I used 4 supervised algorithms using the PCA-reduced and balanced datset: k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classification, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. 

Then, I used another unsupervised technique called k-means clustering to plot 2 features.
